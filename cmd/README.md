# Groove cmd

This folder contains supplementary command-line tools for groove. These tools can be installed independently of groove
(for example, if you are using boogie for a pipeline but need to train a model for use in the pipeline).

To install a tool, use the following command. For example, to install `qcsvm_train_c`:

```bash
go install github.com/hscells/groove/cmd/qcsvm_train_c
```
